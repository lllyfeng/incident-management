    <abstract>
      <t>This document provides an architecture for the incident management
      system and related function interface requirements.</t>

      <t>This document also defines a YANG module to support the incident
      lifecycle management. This YANG module is meant to provide a standard
      way to report, diagnose, and resolve incidents for the sake of enhanced
      network services.</t>

    <section anchor="Introduction" title="Introduction">
      <t>Network performance management and fault management are used for
      monitoring and troubleshooting separately in networking infrastructures.
      Typically, metrics and alarms, transaction operations are monitored
      centrally and incident tickets are triggered accordingly. A YANG <xref
      target="RFC7950"/> data model for alarm management <xref
      target="RFC8632"/> defines a standard interface for alarm
      management.</t>

      <t>A data model for Network and VPN Service Performance Monitoring
      <xref target="RFC9375"/> defines a standard interface for
      performance management. In addition, distributed tracing mechanism
      defined in [W3C-Trace-Context] can also be used to follow, analyze and
      debug operations, such as configuration transactions, across multiple
      distributed systems.</t>

      <t>However, alarm-centric solution described in <xref target="RFC8632"/>,
      performance-centric solution described in <xref target="RFC9375"/>
      and trace context-centric solution are based on a data source specific information
      and maintenance engineers' experience and fall short when keeping track of them separately in
      various different management systems, e.g., the frequency and quantity
      of alarms reported to Operating Support System (OSS) increased
      dramatically (in many cases multiple orders of magnitude) with the
      growth of service types and complexity, hard to aggregate in a single
      domain along with key performance metrics, various different events,
      notifications, overwhelm OSS platforms, result in low processing
      efficiency, inaccurate root cause identification and duplicated
      tickets.</t>

      <t>Usually, the network modeling from device to different connection and
      service layers follows some existing standards. Once there are some
      failures happened on network devices, there could be some correlative
      alarms appeared on the upper layers. Theoretically, it is possible to
      compress a series of alarms into fewer incidents. The
      traditional working manner is also based on this correlation
      relationship. But the traditional working manner is time-consuming and
      labor-intensive which reduces efficiency. Additionally, it quite
      depends on the experience of maintenance engineers. Moreover, the
      investigation of some faults also depends on some other data like
      topology data or performance data. This complicates network
      troubleshooting, and the correlation of alarms and network services. Therefore, it
      is difficult to assess the impact of alarms on network services.</t>

      <t>To address these challenges, an incident-centric solution is
      proposed, which also supports cross-domain or cross-layer root cause
      analysis and network troubleshooting. A network incident refers to an
      unexpected interruption of a network service, degradation of a network
      service quality, or sub-health of a network service. Different data source including
      alarms, metrics and other anomaly information can be aggregated into few amount of incidents
      by correlation analysis and the impact of network services can be assessed based on incidents.
      For example, the protocols related to the interface fail to work properly due to the
      interface down, many alarms may be reported to upper layer management system and can be aggregated
      into one incident, some network services may be affected by this incident (e.g. L3VPN services
      related with the interface will become unavailable). An
      incident may also be raised through the analysis of some network performance metrics, for example,
      as described in SAIN <xref target="I-D.ietf-opsawg-service-assurance-architecture"/>,
      network services can be decomposed to some sub-services, some metrics are monitored for sub-services,
      symptoms will occur if services/sub-services are unhealthy(after analyzing metrics), these symptoms
      may raise one incident, and it may cause degradation of the network service.</t>

      <t>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) play a
      important role in the processing of large amounts of data with complex
      correlations. For example, Neural Network Algorithm or Hierarchy
      Aggregation Algorithm can be used to replace manual alarm correlation.
      Through online and offline learning, these algorithms can be
      continuously optimized to improve the efficiency of fault diagnosis.</t>

      <t>This document defines the concepts, requirements, and architecture of
      incident management. The document also defines a YANG data model for incident
      lifecycle management, which improves troubleshooting efficiency, ensures
      network service quality, and improves network automation <xref

    <section title="Sample Use Cases">
      <section title="Incident-Based Trouble Tickets dispatching">
        <t>Currently, the dispatching of trouble tickets is mostly based on
        dispatching alarms. Some operators' maintenance engineers monitor and
        identify alarms which could link to the same fault. Then they dispatch
        these alarms to the same trouble ticket, which is in low automation. If
        there are many alarms, then the human costs are increased accordingly.</t>

        <t>Some operators preset whitelist and adopt some coarse granularity
        association rules for the alarm management. It seems to improve fault
        management automation. However, some trouble tickets could be missed
        if the filtering conditions are too tight. If the filtering conditions
        are too loose, multiple trouble tickets would be dispatched to the same
        fault.</t>

        <t>It is hard to achieve a perfect balance between the automation and
        duplicated trouble tickets under the traditional working situations.
        However, with the help of incident management, massive alarms can be
        aggregated into a few incidents, multiple trouble tickets will be saved.
        At the same time, incident management can keep high accuracy and
        automation. This could be an answer to this pain point of traditional
        trouble ticket dispatching</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Fault Locating">
        <t>Currently, to accomplish fault isolation and locating work, maintenance experts
        need to combine topology data, service data with huge amount of alarm
        data to do the analysis. Sometimes they also require some cooperation
        from the construction engineers who work on site, to operate fixing
        attempts on devices and then further investigation the root cause is required.</t>

        <t>For example, for a common cable interruption, maintenance experts
        need to analyze the root cause alarm from massive alarms, and then
        trace the root alarm to the faulty span segment by segment. Next, site
        engineers perform tests at the source station to locate the
        interruption and locate the faulty optical exchange station. Then
        travel to the located optical exchange station to replace or splice
        fibers. During the whole process, multiple people are needed inside
        and outside the site.</t>

        <t>With the help of incident management, the system can automatically
        locate the faulty span, and eliminate the need for manual analysis. By
        cooperating with the integrated OTDR within the equipment, we can
        determine the target optical exchange station before site visits.
        Multiple site visits and time are saved.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Fault Labelling">
        <t>Fiber cutover is a common maintenance scenario for Operators.
            During the cutover process, maintenance experts must
        identify affected devices based on the cutover object and their
        experience. They will give these devices a mark to remind other
        maintenance engineers that it is not necessary to dispatch trouble
        tickets before the ending of cutover.</t>

        <t>However, depending on human experience, it is very likely to make
        some mistakes. For example, some devices are missing to mark and some
        devices are marked incorrectly. If the devices are missing to mark,
        some trouble tickets will be dispatched during cutover, which are not
        needed actually. If the devices are wrongly marked, some fault not
        related to this cutover will be missing.</t>

        <t>With incident management, maintenance experts only need to mark the
        cutover objects and do not need to mark the devices that would be
        affected. Because of the alarm aggregation capabilities and knowing
        the relationship between root cause alarm and correlative alarm, the
        fault management system can automatically identify correlative alarms,
        without dispatching any trouble tickets to the affected devices.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Energy Conservation">
        <t>Under the global trend of energy conservation, emission reduction
        and safety management, more and more enterprises have joined the
        energy conservation and emission reduction ranks and adopted measures
        to turn off the power after work during non-working hours, making due
        contributions to the green earth. However, this proactive power-off
        measure periodically generates a large number of alarms on the
        network, and the traditional Operation and Management system can not
        effectively identify such non-real faults caused by the enterprise
        users? operations. Operators need to manually identify and rectify
        faults based on expert experience, wasting a large number of human
        resources.</t>

        <t>Incident management can intelligently identify faults caused by
        periodic power-off on the tenant side and directly identify faults. As
        a result, operators do not need to dispatch trouble tickets for such
        faults any more, this can help to reduce human resource costs.</t>

      <t><xref target="figure_4"/> illustrates the incident management
      architecture. Two key components for the incident management are
      incident management client and incident management agent.</t>

      <t>Incident management agent can be deployed in network analytics
      platform, controllers or Orchestrators and provides functionalities such
      as incident identification, report, diagnosis, resolution, querying for
      incident lifecycle management.</t>

      <t>Incident management client can be deployed in the network OSS or
      other business systems of operators and invokes the functionalities
      provided by incident management agent to meet the business requirements
      of fault management.</t>

      <t>A typical workflow of incident management is as follows: <list
          style="symbols">
          <t>Some alarms or abnormal operations, network performance metrics
          are reported from the network. Incident management agent receives
          these alarms/abnormal operations/metrics and try to analyze the correlation
          of them, if the incidents are identified, it will be reported to the client.
          The impact of network services will be also analyzed and will update the incident.</t>

          <t>Incident management client receives the incident raised by agent,
          and acknowledge it. Client may invoke the 'incident diagnose' rpc to
          diagnose this incident to find the root causes.</t>

          <t>If the root causes have been found, the client can resolve this
          incident by invoking the 'incident resolve' rpc operation,
          dispatching a ticket or using other functions (e.g. routing
          calculation,configuration)</t>
        </list></t>
        <section title="Cooperation with Alarm Management">
            <t>YANG model for alarm management<xref target="RFC8632"/> defines a standard interface to manage the lifecycle of alarms.
            Alarms represent the undesirable state of network resources, alarm data model also defines the root
            causes and impacted services fields, but there may be lack of enough information to determine them in lower
            layer system, so alarms do not always tell the status of services or the root causes. Alarm management act as
            a starting point for high-level fault management, alarms can work as data source of incident agent and
            may be aggregated into few amount of incidents by correlation analysis, network service impact and root causes
            may be determined during incident process.</t>
            <t>Incident also contains some related alarms,if needed users can query the information of alarms by
            alarm management interface <xref target="RFC8632"/>. In some cases, e.g. cutover scenario, incident agent may
            use alarm management interface <xref target="RFC8632"/> to shelve some alarms.</t>
            <t>Alarm management may keep the original process, alarms are reported from network to network controller or
            analytics and then reported to upper layer system(e.g. OSS). Upper layer system may store these alarms and
            provide the information for fault analysis (e.g. deeper analysis based on incident).</t>
        </section>
        <section title="Cooperation with SAIN">
            <t>SAIN <xref target="I-D.ietf-opsawg-service-assurance-architecture"/> defines the architecture of network
            service assurance. A network service can be decomposed into some sub-services, and some metrics can be monitored
            for sub-services. For example, a tunnel service can be decomposed into some peer tunnel interface sub-services
            and IP connective sub-service. If some metrics are evaluated to indicate unhealthy sub-services, some symptoms
            will occur. Incident agent may identify the incident based on symptoms, and then report it to upper layer system.
            So, SAIN can be one way to identify incident, services, sub-services and metrics can be preconfigured via APIs
            defined by service assurance YANG model <xref target="I-D.ietf-opsawg-service-assurance-yang"/> and incident
            will be reported if symptoms match the condition of incident.</t>
        </section>
        <section title="Relationship with RFC8969">
            <t>RFC8969<xref target="RFC8969"/> defines a framework for network automation using YANG, this framework divides
            YANG modules into three layers, service layer, network layer and device layer, and contains service deployment,
            service optimization/assurance, and service diagnosis. Incident works on network layer and aggregates alarms,
            metrics and other information from device layer, it's helpful for service assurance. And incident diagnosis may
            be one way of service diagnosis.</t>

        <t>As described in <xref target="figure_1"/>, multiple alarms,
              metrics, or hybrid can be aggregated into an incident after analysis.</t>

        <t>The incident management agent MUST be capable of identifying
        incidents. Multiple alarms, metrics and other information are reported to
        incident agent, and the agent must analyze it and find out the correlations of them,
        if the correlation match the incident rules, incident will be identified and reported to
        the client. Service impact analysis will be performed if an indent is identified, and
        the content of incident will be updated if impacted network services are detected.</t>

        <t>AI/ML may be used to identify the incident. Expert system and online learning can help
        AI to identify the correlation of alarms, metrics and other information by time-base
        correlation algorithm, topo-based correlation algorithm, etc. For example, if interface
        is down, then many protocol alarms will be reported, AI will think these alarms
        have some correlations. These correlations will be put into knowledge base, and the
        incident will be identified faster according to knowledge base next time.</t>
        <t>As mentioned above, SAIN is another way to implement incident identification. Observation timestamp
        defined in <xref target="I-D.tgraf-yang-push-observation-time"/> and trace context defined in
        <xref target="W3C-Trace-Context"/> may be helpful for incident identification.</t>

      <section title="Incident Diagnosis">
        <t>After an incident is reported to the incident management client, the
        client MAY diagnose the incident to determine the root cause. Some
        diagnosis operations may affect the running network services. The
        client can choose not to perform that diagnosis operation after
        determining the impact is not trivial. The incident management agent
        can also perform self-diagnosis. However, the self-diagnosis MUST not
        affect the running network services. Possible diagnosis methods
        include link reachability detection, link quality detection, alarm/log
        analysis, and short-term fine-grained monitoring of network quality
        metrics, etc.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Incident Resolution">
        <t>After the root cause is diagnosed, the client MAY resolve the
        incident. The client MAY choose resolve the incident by invoking other
        functions, such as routing calculation function, configuration
        function, dispatching a ticket or asking the agent to resolve it.
        Generally, the client would attempt to directly resolve the root
        cause. If the root cause cannot be resolved, an alternative solution
        SHOULD be required. For example, if an incident caused by a physical
        component failure, it cannot be automatically resolved, the standby
        link can be used to bypass the faulty component.</t>

        <t>Incident agent will monitor the status of incident, if the faults are fixed,
        the agent will update the status of incident to 'cleared', and report the updated
        incident to the client.</t>

        <t>Incident resolution may affect the running network services. The
        client can choose not to perform those operations after determining
        the impact is not trivial.</t>

    <section title="Incident Data Model Concepts">
      <section title="Identifying the Incident Instance">
        <t> An incident ID is used as an identifier of an incident instance,
            if an incident instance is identified, a new incident ID is created.
            The incident ID MUST be unique in the whole system.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="The Incident Lifecycle">
        <section title="Incident Instance Lifecycle">
          <t>From an incident instance perspective, an incident can have the
          following lifecycle: 'raised', 'updated', 'cleared'. When an
          incident is generated, the status is 'raised'. If the status changes
          after the incident is generated, (for example, self-diagnosis,
          diagnosis command issued by the client, or any other condition
          causes the status to change but does not reach the 'cleared' level.)
          , the status changes to 'updated'. When an incident is successfully
          resolved, the status changes to 'cleared'.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Operator Incident Lifecycle">
          <t>From an operator perspective, the lifecycle of an incident
          instance includes 'acknowledged', 'diagnosed', and 'resolved'. When
          an incident instance is generated, the operator SHOULD acknowledge
          the incident. And then the operator attempts to diagnose the
          incident (for example, find out the root cause and affected
          components). Diagnosis is not mandatory. If the root cause and
          affected components are known when the incident is generated,
          diagnosis is not required. After locating the root cause and
          affected components, operator can try to resolve the incident.</t>

    "This module defines the interfaces for incident management
     lifecycle.

     This module is intended for the following use cases:
     * incident lifecycle management:
       - incident report: report incident instance to client
                          when an incident instance is detected.
       - incident acknowledge: acknowledge an incident instance.
       - incident diagnose: diagnose an incident instance.
       - incident resolve: resolve an incident instance.

      <t>The YANG modules specified in this document define a schema for data
      that is designed to be accessed via network management protocol such as
      NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [RFC8040]. The lowest NETCONF layer is the
      secure transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport
      is Secure Shell (SSH) [RFC6242]. The lowest RESTCONF layer is HTTPS, and
      the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS [RFC8446].</t>

      <t>There are a number of data nodes defined in this YANG module that are
      writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the default).
      These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some
      network environments. Write operations (e.g., edit-config) to these data
      nodes without proper protection can have a negative effect on network
      operations. These are the subtrees and data nodes and their
      sensitivity/vulnerability:</t>

      <t>Some of the readable data nodes in this YANG module may be considered
